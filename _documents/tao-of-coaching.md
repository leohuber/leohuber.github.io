Coaching can be done in different ways depending on the situation, the skills of the coachee or the task to be completed, coaching can be achieved by:

* Asking questions
* Make suggestions
* Demonstrate
* Give advice
* Tell what and how

Each of these options has its advantages and disadvantages. The coach might have to analyze the situation first and adapt the method used depending on:

* Skills of coaches
* Task to be performed (is it a repetitive or a creative task)
* Time constraints
* Failure tolerance
